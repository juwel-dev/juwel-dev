# 👋 Hi, I’m Jens-Uwe

**Solution Architect | Systems Thinker**

I design software systems where technology, ownership, and organizational reality meet.

My focus is not just building systems — it’s building systems that survive scale and real-world complexity.

## 🧩 Architecture Style

I design systems where decisions have technical and organizational consequences.

Technology is rarely the hardest part. Alignment, ownership, and operability are.

My design principles:

- System boundaries follow ownership
- Platforms must be operable by the teams who run them
- Governance should scale clarity, not control
- Technical debt often reflects structural debt
