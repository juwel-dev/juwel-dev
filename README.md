# 👋 Hi, I’m Jens-Uwe

**Solution Architect | Systems Thinker**

I design software systems where technology, ownership, and organizational reality meet.

My focus is not just building systems —  
it’s building systems that survive scale, governance, and real-world complexity.

## 🧩 Architecture Style

I design systems where decisions have technical and organizational consequences.

Technology is rarely the hardest part.
Alignment, ownership, and operability are.

My design principles:

- System boundaries follow ownership
- Platforms must be operable by the teams who run them
- Governance should scale clarity, not control
- Technical debt often reflects structural debt

If incentives and system design fight each other, the system will degrade — regardless of tooling.

## 🎯 What I Care About

- Long-term ownership over short-term delivery  
- Clear system boundaries  
- Operable platforms  
- Decision traceability  
- Reducing cognitive load for teams  

Good architecture reduces friction —  
in code, in teams, and in decisions.
