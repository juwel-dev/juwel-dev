# 👋 Hi, I’m Jens-Uwe

**Solution Architect | Systems Thinker | Platform & Observability**

I design software systems where technology, ownership, and organizational reality meet.

My focus is not just building systems —  
it’s building systems that survive scale, governance, and real-world complexity.

## 🧩 Architecture Style

I work from a socio-technical perspective.

Architecture fails less because of bad technology  
and more because of misaligned ownership, incentives, and operating models.

How I think:

- System boundaries follow ownership boundaries  
- Operability is a design requirement  
- Platforms shape team behavior  
- Governance should scale clarity, not control  
- Technical debt often signals structural debt  

I design in feedback loops:

System → Team → Incentives → Behavior → Outcomes

If those loops fight each other, the architecture will fail — regardless of tooling.

## 🎯 What I Care About

- Long-term ownership over short-term delivery  
- Clear system boundaries  
- Operable platforms  
- Decision traceability  
- Reducing cognitive load for teams  

Good architecture reduces friction —  
in code, in teams, and in decisions.
