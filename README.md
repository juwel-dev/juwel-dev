# 👋 Hi, I’m Jens-Uwe

**Solution Architect | Systems Thinker | Platform & Observability**

I design software systems from the perspective of structure, operability, and long-term evolution — not just feature delivery.

My focus is the space where engineering, architecture, and organizational reality meet.

---

## 🧠 How I Think as an Architect

- Architecture is about **ownership**, not diagrams  
- Operability is a **design requirement**, not an afterthought  
- Governance should **enable engineering**, not block it  
- Every decision has a **traceable context**  
- Platforms exist to **reduce cognitive load** for teams  

---

## 🛠️ What I Work With

**Platform & Cloud**
- Kubernetes
- Helm
- Platform tooling & service architectures

**Development**
- TypeScript / Node.js / React
- C#
- Java
- Rust
- Python

## 🧩 Architecture Interests

- Platform engineering models  
- Observability architecture  
- Architecture governance & quality gates  
- Developer enablement systems  
- Vendor vs. build strategy  
- Decision traceability

---

## 🧩 Architecture Style — Socio-Technical

I design systems as socio-technical organisms — technology, people, and incentives are inseparable.

- Architecture must work in the org, not just on paper  
- Every system decision creates organizational impact  
- Technical debt often reflects structural debt  
- Governance is a coordination mechanism  
- Platform design is organizational design  

I think in feedback loops:
System → Team → Incentives → Behavior → System

Good architecture aligns these loops instead of fighting them.

## 🎸 Outside of Tech

- Guitarist & music producer  
- Mixing & sound design  

Systems thinking applies to sound, too.

## ⚡ Philosophy

> Structure creates freedom.

- Good architecture reduces complexity  
- Clear systems scale people, not just software  
- Long-term ownership beats short-term delivery
